      One space after a colon.<br>
      There is a traditional American practice,
      favored by some, of leaving two spaces after colons and periods.
      This practice is discouraged by the University of Chicago Press,
      especially for formally published works and the manuscripts from which they are published.

    <p>
      I have confusion regarding the correct spacing after periods and other closing punctuation.
      My company uses the font Arial and consistently uses a flush-left margin.
      We are an engineering company.
      My job consists in preparing documents and letters for customers.
      Everything I read in manuals and from technical writers directs me to use one space after  periods.
